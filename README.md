## Getting Started

[Download The Template as Zip File](https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

Unzip and rename the folder to your actual project name.

Run `npm ci` in the project root folder, then `npm run dev`

The web app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

To display ESLint errors in Visual Studio Code, install the official ESLint extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

## Project Structure

### `components` Folder

Place reusable React components in this folder.

It is recommended to write newer components as [Functional Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) (with [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)) instead of Class Components for simplicity.

### `css` Folder

Place plain `.css` files in this folder.

If there are [reusable JS style objects](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) (CSS-in-JS), it is recommended to place them in `components` folder instead.

### `functions` Folder

Place reusable plain JS functions in this folder.

### `pages` Folder

In Next.js, a page is a default-exported React Component from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

> **Example:** If `pages/about.tsx` is created, it will be accessible at `/about`.

Next.js supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if a file is called `pages/posts/[id].tsx`, then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.

> Read more about pages: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages

> Read more about dynamic routes: https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes

### `pages/_app.tsx` File

Next.js uses the `App` component to initialize pages which can be overridden to allow:

- Persisting layout between page changes

- Keeping state when navigating pages

- [Custom error handling using `componentDidCatch`](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)

- Inject additional data into pages

- [Add global CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet)

This template ships with `_app.tsx` file which implements some of the above mentioned behaviors, including additional features:

- Progress bar on navigation

- OpenID Connect provider configuration

- Opting-out from [Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) to allow the use of [Runtime Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/runtime-configuration) in container-based deployments

> Read more about custom `App`: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app

### `public` Folder

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

> Read more about static files: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving

### `types` Folder

Place type declarations in this folder. For example: `interface` or `type` or [`.d.ts`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html) files.

### `.eslintrc.json` File

ESLint configuration file for TypeScript and Next.js (`next/core-web-vitals` including `react` and `react-hooks` ESLint plugins).

> Read more about ESLint configuration: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/

### `package.json` & `package.lock.json` Files

The `package.json` file is a manifest for the project. It is where `npm` store the names and versions for all the installed packages. The `package.json` shipped with the template describes the following (but not limited to) metadata:

- `private` if set to `true` prevents the app to be accidentally published on `npm`

- `scripts` defines a set of scripts runnable via [`npm run`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-run-script)

- `dependencies` sets a list of npm packages installed as runtime dependencies

- `devDependencies` sets a list of npm packages installed as development dependencies, which are not installed in Production environments.

> Read more about `package.json`: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-json-guide

`package-lock.json` is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates. This file is intended to be committed into source repositories.

> Read more about `package.lock.json`: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-lock-json-file

**Restoring packages should be done using `npm ci` NOT `npm install` command to prevent accidentally modifying the `package.json` and `package.lock.json`**

### `tsconfig.json` File

The presence of a `tsconfig.json` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

The `tsconfig.json` shipped with the template has been fine-tuned for strict Next.js project type-checking.

> List of all supported TypeScript compiler options: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html

### `next.config.js` File

For custom advanced configuration of Next.js (such as webpack), `next.config.js` in the root of the project directory (next to package.json) can be modified.

`next.config.js` is a regular Node.js module and gets used by the Next.js server and build phases. It is not included in the browser build.

## Building and Running Production Build

```sh
npm run build
```

```sh
npx cross-env \
    NODE_ENV='production' \
    NEXTAUTH_URL='http://localhost' \
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET='e01b7895a403fa7364061b2f01a650fc' \
    BACKEND_API_HOST='https://demo.duendesoftware.com' \
    OIDC_ISSUER='https://demo.duendesoftware.com' \
    OIDC_CLIENT_ID='interactive.public.short' \
    OIDC_SCOPE='openid profile email api offline_access' \
    npm run start
```

> **DO NOT FORGET** to randomize `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value for Production Environment with https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 or `openssl rand -base64 32`

To use HTTPS Certificate, simply use reverse proxy such as [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/) or [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/).

## Building and Running as Container

This template ships with `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for building the app as a standard container image. To proceed, please [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or any OCI container CLI such as [`podman`](https://podman.io/) in your machine. (The examples given will use Docker)

To build the container image, use this command:

```sh
docker build -t my-app .
```

> Run this command on the same directory level as `Dockerfile` file. 

> Note that all `.env` and `.env.*` files are listed as ignored files in `.dockerignore` to prevent unwanted Environment Variables leaking to Production environment.

When running container locally, it is recommended to create a dedicated network for containers inside to connect to each other: 

```sh
docker network create my-network
```

```sh
docker run \
    -e NEXTAUTH_URL="https://www.my-website.com" \
    -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="e01b7895a403fa7364061b2f01a650fc" \
    -e BACKEND_API_HOST="https://demo.duendesoftware.com" \
    -e OIDC_ISSUER="https://demo.duendesoftware.com" \
    -e OIDC_CLIENT_ID="interactive.public.short" \
    -e OIDC_SCOPE="openid profile email api offline_access" \
    -p 80:80 \
    --network my-network \
    --restart always \
    --name my-container \
    -d my-app
```

> **DO NOT FORGET** to randomize `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value for Production Environment with https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 or `openssl rand -base64 32`

## `AppSettings` API

[Next.js allows using `process.env` to read Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables), but it is not suitable for container-based deployment because the Environment Variables are burned during build-time (non-changeable).

This technique does not adhere to [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/build-release-run) methodology: a release is defined as a combination of a build (i.e. Container) + a config (i.e. Environment Variables).

![Build, Release, Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/master/public/release.png)

For this reason, [Runtime Configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/runtime-configuration) is recommended to be used instead.

This project template ships [`AppSettings`](https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/blob/master/functions/AppSettings.ts) API as a high-level abstraction of the runtime Environment Variables:

```
Environment Variables --> next.config.js --> AppSettings
``` 

### Environment Variables

The values of Environment Variables are sourced differently depending on how the app is being run:

* Development environment using `npm run dev`: values will be obtained from `.env` files such as `.env.development` or `.env.local`

> Read more about Environment Variables Load Order: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#environment-variable-load-order

* Production environment using container (build with `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` in this template): values will be obtained from Machine Environment Variables supplied via `-e` or `--env` flag.

> Read more about Environment Variables in Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file

### Add Environment Variables to `next.config.js`

To register Environment Variables into the app, open `next.config.js` and modify the `serverRuntimeConfig` field.

The Environment Variables will only be available on the server-side code. (in `getServerSideProps` or in API routes)

For example:

```ts
{
    serverRuntimeConfig: {
        myEnv: process.env['MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE'],
    },
}
```

> Read more for explanation about this behavior: https://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2021/04/buildtime-vs-runtime-environment-variables-nextjs-docker/

### Using `AppSettings`

Import the `AppSettings` object from `getServerSideProps` to read registered Environment Variables and pass it down to the page as props. For example:

```tsx
import { AppSettings } from '../functions/AppSettings';

const MyPage: Page<{
    myEnv: string
}> = ({ myEnv }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                {myEnv}
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default MyPage;

export async function getServerSideProps() {
    return {
        props: {
            myEnv: AppSettings.current.myEnv
        },
    }
}

```

> Environment Variables have `string` data type

## `Page` & Layout

The `Page` interface shipped with this project template extends the standard `React.FunctionComponent` interface, with an additional static property named `layout`. The `layout` property allows attaching a render function which returns the layout for a specific page.

The below example illustrates how to develop a layout function and attach it to a page:

```tsx
// components/MyLayout.tsx

import React from "react";

const MyLayout: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <main className="container py-4">
                {children}
            </main>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}

// This layout pattern enables state persistence because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions.
// With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.
export const WithMyLayout = (page: React.ReactElement) => <MyLayout>{page}</MyLayout>;
```

```tsx
// pages/MyPage.tsx

import { Page } from '../types/Page';
import { WithMyLayout } from '../components/MyLayout';

const MyPage: Page = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

MyPage.layout = WithMyLayout;
export default MyPage;
```

> Read more about Per-Page Layouts: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts#per-page-layouts

## Default SWR Fetcher

This template ships with an [SWR Fetcher implemented with the Axios library](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/data-fetching#axios). 

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { DefaultSwrFetcher } from "../../functions/DefaultSwrFetcher";

const TestPage: React.FC = () => {
    const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/demo/api/Values', DefaultSwrFetcher);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                {JSON.stringify(data)}
            </p>
            <p>
                {error?.toString()}
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The default SWR fetcher is configured with these request headers:

```ts
{
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache',
    'Expires': '0',
}
```

## API Gateway

For security reasons, HTTP requests initiated from a browser is restricted to the same domain ([Same-Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)) and the same protocol (HTTPS requests must be performed from web pages with HTTPS URL).

> For example, `https://front-end.app` accessing `http://back-end.app/api/data` will fail by default.

To ease development against microservices, this template ships an implementation of API Gateway which allows bypassing Same-Origin Policy by proxying HTTP requests through the Next.js server. The API Gateway is implemented using [API Routes for Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

> The content `/pages/api/demo/[...apiGateway].ts` file: 

```tsx
import Proxy from 'http-proxy';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { AppSettings } from '../../../functions/AppSettings';

// Great way to avoid using CORS and making API calls from HTTPS pages to back-end HTTP servers
// Recommendation for projects in Kubernetes cluster: set target to Service DNS name instead of public DNS name
const server = Proxy.createProxyServer({
    target: AppSettings.current.backendHost,
    changeOrigin: true,
    xfwd: true,
    // https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy#proxying-websockets
    ws: false,
});

server.on('proxyReq', (proxyReq, req) => {
    // Proxy requests from /api/demo/... to http://my-web-api.com/...
    const urlRewrite = req.url?.replace(new RegExp('^/api/demo'), '');
    if (urlRewrite) {
        proxyReq.path = urlRewrite;
    } else {
        proxyReq.path = '/';
    }
    // console.log('Proxying:', req.url, '-->', AppSettings.current.backendHost + urlRewrite);
});

const apiGateway = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    server.web(req, res, {}, (err) => {
        if (err instanceof Error) {
            throw err;
        }

        throw new Error(`Failed to proxy request: '${req.url}'`);
    });
}

export default apiGateway;

export const config = {
    api: {
        externalResolver: true,
        bodyParser: false
    },
}
```

The above implementation allows forwarding from the Next.js API Route to the actual back-end API URL. For example: `/api/demo/api/Values` is forwarded to the `http://back-end/api/Values`

```tsx
// Fetch data from http://back-end/api/Values
const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/demo/api/Values', swrFetcher);
```

For clarity, it is recommended to create separate API Routes for different back-end microservices. (e.g. `/api/employees`, `/api/products`, etc.)

When deployed in Kubernetes, the target host can be declared as a valid [RFC 1035 label name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#rfc-1035-label-names) instead of a public DNS to enable managing microservices using Kubernetes CoreDNS.

For example, if the target host name is `my-service`, then the back-end web API can be [declared as a ClusterIP or LoadBalancer Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service) with the same name and is reachable from the Next.js API Gateway via `http://my-service`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: DemoBackEndWebApi
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

## Step Debugging with Visual Studio Code

This template ships with Visual Studio Code step debugging support. Simply press F5 to start debugging.

When only client-side debugging is required, **ensure `npm run dev` is already running** and choose the `Next.js: Debug Client-Side` launch configuration. Breakpoint can now be placed in source code lines which run in the browser-side.

When server-side debugging is required, **ensure `npm run dev` is NOT running** and choose the `Next.js: Debug Full-Stack` launch configuration. Breakpoint can now be placed in source code lines which runs in the server-side, in addition to the browser-side.

> The debug configuration can be selected from the Run & Debug Sidebar (CTRL + SHIFT + D)

The debugging experience is set to use the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge by default (which should be installed by default in newer Windows 10 and Windows 11). If this is not desirable, feel free to modify the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

To enrich the React development experience, install the official [React Developer Tools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) in the browser used for debugging. 

## GitHub CI Integration

This project template ships with GitHub Action workflow for Docker Images enabled. Example: https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/actions

When a commit is pushed or a merge request is performed against the `master` or `main` branch, a container image will be build. If a commit is pushed, then the container image will also be pushed into the GitHub Container Registry of the project as `master` or `main` tag.

Upon tagging a commit (if using GitHub web, go to [Releases](https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/releases) page then [draft a new release](https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/releases/new)) with version number string such as `v1.0.0` (notice the mandatory `v` prefix), a new container image will be build and tagged as the version number (in this example, resulting in `1.0.0` image tag, notice the lack of `v` prefix) and `latest`.

The container images are available via the project [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/accelist/nextjs-starter/pkgs/container/nextjs-starter). For example: 

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/accelist/nextjs-starter:master
```

If working with private repository (hence private container registry), [create a new GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `read:packages` scope to allow downloading container images from Kubernetes cluster.

> Read more: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry

## GitLab CI Integration

This project template ships with GitLab CI pipeline for container builds enabled. Example: https://gitlab.com/ryanelian/nextjs-starter/-/pipelines

When a commit is pushed or a merge request is performed against the `master` or `main` branch, a container image will be build. If a commit is pushed, then the container image will also be pushed into the GitLab Container Registry of the project as `master` or `main` tag.

Upon tagging a commit (if using GitLab web, go to [Tags](https://gitlab.com/ryanelian/nextjs-starter/-/tags) page then [create a new tag](https://gitlab.com/ryanelian/nextjs-starter/-/tags/new)) with version number string such as `1.0.0`, a new container image will be build and tagged as the version number (in this example, resulting in identical `1.0.0` image tag) and `latest`.

The container images are available via the project [GitLab Container Registry](https://gitlab.com/ryanelian/nextjs-starter/container_registry). For example: 

```sh
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/ryanelian/nextjs-starter:master
```

If working with private repository (hence private container registry), [create a new GitLab personal access token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with `read_registry` scope to allow downloading container images from Kubernetes cluster.

> Read more: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html

## Deploying Container to Kubernetes

> TODO add guide for adding GitHub / GitLab personal access token to Kubernetes for pulling from private registry: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/

> TODO add Deployment and Services `yaml` here with Environment Variables

## Git Pre-Commit Compile Check

Upon launching development server via `npm run dev`, git pre-commit hook will be installed into the local repository.

This hook will perform TypeScript and ESLint checks when a developer attempts to commit into the git repository and fail the commit if any errors are detected.
